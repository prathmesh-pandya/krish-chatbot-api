Will Rogers Challenges Plotting Challenges Absence of established conversion data modalities Tedious data dumping between two systems Lack of multi-lingual support Integration of online deposit functionality Creating comprehensive APIs and postman collections Collaborating effectively with multiple extended teams The need to transition to a headless architecture while maintaining seamless UX & functionality. Solution Architecting Solutions We began addressing the requirement by identifying the pertinent data for categorization within the real estate system and devising a clear strategy for nesting to facilitate effective data organization.
