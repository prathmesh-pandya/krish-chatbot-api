Challenges Faced by Brands Knowing what's stopping you helps you make informed business decisions, and we are here not just to address the elephant in the room but to make 'him' go away! Poor Data Management Collecting data is important, but poor management of collected data is as similar as no data. Businesses lack the expertise to put the data to use that can help them make performance-centric business decisions. Collecting, utilizing, and optimizing data for better business decisions is how a business can scale. Devising actionable data insights that help with improved CX requires expertise that many business leaders struggle with! Inconsistency in PIM Product Information Management (PIM) solutions highly rely on accurate data musters. Accurately managing, curating, and distributing content is at the heart of PIM. A lack of meaningful data segmentation creates inconsistencies in PIM and overall content distribution to various channels and touchpoints - such scenarios wrack the product information management leading to hampering brand CX and operational efficacy. Silos in CDP Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) play a vital role in building consistent brand experience (BX). The major role a CDP plays is to eliminate data silos, bring harmony, and create a connected learning environment for fuild inter-departmental operations. When the data is collected in silos without any proven strategy to merge and utilize it, the insights derived may create a half-drawn picture that businesses should not rely on. Lack of Personalization Individuality has gained momentum in recent years, and there is a dire need for hyper-personalized digital experiences!
