Anonymous Challenges Defining The Porosity / Wedging Out the Issues Integration Complexity due to divergent data structures Inability to maintain uniformity across customer data in sales CRM and product information Scalability Strain with an escalating user base Safeguarding the system across multiple platforms and integration points Difficulty crafting a consistent and engaging journey across various platforms and devices. Payment Gateway Integration Hurdles Solution Crafting The Moulds Krish proposed API standardization through custom composables, ensuring uniform data exchange formats and simplifying integration complexities. Automated testing became a linchpin, with comprehensive suites validating data consistency, functionality, and performance.

We also helped them with seamless API integration with sales CRM facilitated real-time updates for customer information. Later, we ensured that BloomReach, as their CMS of choice, efficiently managed content such as product information and promotional material. Our team also implemented Coveo, an AI-driven search tool, to augment product discovery with powerful search capabilities and insightful analytics. Lastly, we helped Moomin Arabia with Adyen integration within the SAP Commerce Cloud backend, specially orchestrated to handle various payment scenarios and streamline order completion.
