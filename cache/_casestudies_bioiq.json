By seamlessly connecting people to health testing through BioIQ’s software, it makes testing more accessible, creates more insight for people and allows more touchpoints with health service partners. Krish was engaged to develop BioIQ’s next-generation portal and associated mobile apps based on Magento’s eCommerce framework. Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. Joseph Pilates Challenges Acknowledging the Challenges Site security and HIPAA compliance Attracting and engaging users. Building iOS and Android apps for additional mobile user functionalities Custom API’s / Connections into BioIQ’s Core backend systems Ensuring a seamless experience for B2B2C customers Solution Creating A Healthy Environment The primary emphasis for BioIQ was on attracting people to visit and share their details. The secondary aim was to have this information sorted and aligned for easy access. Krish’s team worked on a solution that made both these goals a reality! We added a couple of additional steps to the checkout flow that helped in getting more data from the customers to provide them the better service. The Strategy This was a fast-moving and technically challenging project. The MVP was accomplished in eight weeks with multiple iterations post-launch to continue to add features to the site, all while working closely with a new internal team hired by BioIQ. The goal was to enable BioIQ to spin-up highly configurable microsites (i.e., White labeled B2B sites) with non-technical resources. Each site was customizable in its UI as well as content and offerings. Our teams worked in an agile manner with daily calls and multiple workshops to ensure timely and consistent rollouts of new functionality. Due to HIPAA compliance and data security requirements, the site was built on secured hardware internal to BioIQ. Additionally, multiple levels of authentication allowed the front-end to be secured for appropriate access by BioIQ customers. Technology Mobile First Design Understood the vision and delivered on a truly on-brand experience. Client Speaks Steve Orlando Project Manager \"When we saw a rise in digitization and people relying on their mobiles for convenience, we knew we wanted to improve our mobile experience. That's when we contacted Krish, and they came up with a combined solution to enhance our overall site experience. Working with them turned out to be smooth and eventful. From the first meeting itself, we experienced the team's in-depth knowledge of the Magento platform. Within no time, the task was under pipeline and came out afresh. I would surely recommend Krish for your online commerce enhancement.\" Result Flaunting the Boosted Online Presence Just as the team began work on the project, COVID-19 hit the world. The project was pivoted mid-way to allow for the prioritization of certain additions to the microsites around COVID-19, including a Testing Center finder, an updated Test Results page, and a full-fledged Covid-19 assessment toolkit. This toolkit presents the customer with a multiple-question assessment and based on their answer options, and the system will suggest the best suitable medical solution. This is just another example of Krish’ ability to build, test and deploy high-quality features for our clients—even in the most trying times.
