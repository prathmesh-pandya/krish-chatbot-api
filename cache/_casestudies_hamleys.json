Krish Technolabs has helped them with Consulting & UX Development, Integration, & Growth Support.\n\n\nBack To Work Europe Solution B2C | Digital Marketing SERVICES Consulting & UX DesignDevelopment & IntegrationGrowth Support INDUSTRY Kids & Education WEBSITE Hamleys 147,818 New Users 2629 New Orders 1.28s Page Load Time Building Blocks Of Perfection in The Toy World with Exceptional Commerce Stepping into the World's Largest Playground of Fun in London The story begins in 1760 when William Hamley saw a dream of opening a toy shop that became one of the finest toy shops in the world by 1837. Despite unwanted circumstances like World War 2, the later-acquired brand by Walter Lines was able to bag the Royal Warrant by Queen Mary in 1938! Later, Queen Elizabeth 2 continued the legacy by honoring him with the Royal Warrant of a 'Toys and Sports Merchant’ in 1955. And it became a famous landmark in London, standing tall at Regent Street, London, England. However, with a big name comes a bigger responsibility. Hamleys wished to upgrade its on-site performance, offer convenience to its customers, and reach the audience where it was. They consulted Krish to amplify its online presence to maintain its legacy and standards. “ Toys are merely ideas brought to life.” Melissa Crawley Challenges Defining Stumbles In The Toy Town Code Audit and Fixes SEO optimization Third-party ERP integration Site performance issues Erratic payment facilitation Insufficient Shipping Method Solution Becoming an Unrivaled Toy Heaven For Children Hamleys had an aim to simplify their processes in and out. Krish began with a rigorous code audit to discover bugs, security breaches and offered a version upgrade. Additionally, our experts suggested the toy giant with a simplified and effective integrated event-booking system to deliver engaging virtual & hybrid events while garnering valuable insights from the attendees. Then, we worked on giving Hamleys a seamless dropship vendor integration to allow other vendors to sell products on its website. With a set flow of orders, it was time to help them manage their ERP connectivity with their inventory to ensure a smoother order flow sync. Due to a heavy influx of customers, Hamleys required an elevated level of checkout, payment, and shipping processes from same-day to custom shipping methods and an EMI option. Team Krish helped the brand by devising a visually pleasing theme, improved site performance, and overall SEO content optimization strategy. The Strategy Building Treasures Holding The Secrets of Endless Play Hamleys carries a huge reputation for being the best in the world, and team Krish took that seriously. We began by offering Magento 2 Cloud capabilities to build a feature-rich eCommerce platform and implemented Algolia as a search platform to help users find and navigate easily. While this ran successfully, we implemented Microsoft D365 to manage their ERP. Plus, an integrated event booking system helped Hamleys manage its hybrid & virtual events well. Further, we integrated their vendor system as well as GFS checkout for both - next-day and named-day shipping methods. Team Krish also leveraged Klarna with an EMI option to bring in an easy option of EMIs for the customers. With that, we also helped the brand with 3rd party ticketing system for customer queries and enabled auto address fill-up with geolocation. On the customer-facing aspects, we utilized high-performing platforms such as Mailchimp and Salesforce to reach en masse with email marketing tactics for the brand. Technology Mobile First Design Understood the vision and delivered on a truly on-brand experience. Client Speaks “We are loving the new eCommerce platform offered by team Krish.
