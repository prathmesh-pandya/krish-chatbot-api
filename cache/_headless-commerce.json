Headless eCommerce is a modernized site infrastructure that keeps the front-end consumer-facing touchpoints known as the ‘head’, decoupled from the back-end operational systems to streamline workflows. This no-strings-attached approach disseminates the consumer-facing front from the system concerns, reducing the need to dive into the back end for every iteration of your commerce strategy. In the Headless approach, customer-facing systems and backend aren’t interdependent as it is in the monolith architecture. This gives your business the flexibility, agility, and velocity needed to build an experience-driven framework. Schedule a Call Headless commerce is the future that has arrived! Going headless allows two tightly coupled ends to work independently where the frontend and backend are not interdependent and can scale without limits. In the Headless approach, customer-facing systems and backend aren’t interdependent. Instead, they are connected through API layers that work separately for each function. This gives your business the flexibility, agility, and velocity needed to build an experience-driven framework.
