Client Speaks Piyush Sinha Digital Practice \"The team was able to meet all of the goals set by the company for the project. The company appreciated that the team was responsive to all of their concerns regarding updates and on the progress of the project. Besides communication, the team also trained the company in managing the project.\" Result Caressing organization's growth with newly launched platform Since the platform was completely new and it was for the first time it made a presence amidst an audience, there aren't any growth statistics. However, the two vital figures that clearly narrated successful implementation of the project included, mobile traffic and average load time. While the former showed 53% mobile footfall assuring responsiveness, the latter further confirmed it with page load time of 1.38 seconds. We hope that the team DSS attains new benchmarks in coming months and years.
