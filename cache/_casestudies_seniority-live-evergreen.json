While the brand initially had an online presence through Magento 1x, the increasing footfall with other operational issues raised the need for improved presence. 'Age is an issue of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.' Mark Twain Challenges Finding and understanding the Gap Over-engineered codebase with numerous 3rd party extensions and loosely defined business logic/workflow. Loosely integrated Warehousing System resulting in a constant backlog of pending & unattended orders. Confusing mobile navigation and irregular responsive web layout increasing customer churn rate & product-search difficult. Frequent site crash not just served poor experience also made paid campaigns and upfront marketing a complete loss. Dual customer identity by email address and the mobile number was confusing the audience, eventually impacting the brand’s goodwill. Channelizing appropriate strategy over predictive analysis to ensure calculative steps and well-defined approach. Solution Bridging the Gap Soon after the completion of the initial analysis, departments started working on implementing required ingredients to ensure that the online store gets adorned with features and benefits it needs to earn the loyalty of its target audience by easing and simplifying the overall shopping experience. The Strategy Being aimed to serve senior citizens, besides technology the brand needed to balance the overall experience across two generations; elderly people and caretakers. Hence, the team emphasized on larger fonts and additional whitespace between interface elements, no hidden menus, simplifying form filling, limited options per page, and providing obvious escapes or exists in case a user gets stuck. Technology Mobile First Design Understood the vision and delivered on a truly on-brand experience. Client Speaks Shankey Poddar Product Head, Seniority Pvt.
