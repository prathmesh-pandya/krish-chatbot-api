Being an industry leader with their online store, the brand is a widely acknowledged distributor of lighting products. They are a licensed dealer of leading brands like CREE, RAB Lighting, Lutron, GE, and JUNO Lighting, among others. While it was all going well until they noticed they needed a better platform to boost their business. Successful digital commerce is about delivering more than expected.

The experts at Krish soon carved out an upgrade strategy to fulfill the vision of the brand and fix the loopholes hampering the performance. The Strategy Key elements included design, interface, enhancing buying experience, lessening the load time, etc. While the first step was to re-platform from a SaaS eCommerce solution to a Magento Enterprise suite in order to enable an intelligent path to customers, the team also considered restructuring catalog and customer data with all essential segregations to improve navigation flow. This enabled targeted promotions for discount campaigns and volume discount slabs for bulk buyers. Technology Mobile First Design Delivering a mobile-first layout to cater to M-Commerce customers. Client Speaks Kyle Kluska President, PROLIGHTING Group Result Enchanting and expanding with Magento Enterprise Once went live, the brand did gain the attention of Magento and got nominated under the best commerce launch in the 2016 category.
