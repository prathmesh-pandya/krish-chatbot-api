Barack Obama Challenges Understanding the sky Store Performance was not up to the mark. Checkout Abandonment was high. The search was not performing well. There were design flaws and important content was not being highlighted. Solution Finding direction amidst strong waves Considering the wide range of products, the target audience, and the challenges outlined by the client, our team conducted an in-depth analysis to re-authenticate buyer behavior. To enhance performance and user experience, we implemented a comprehensive optimization strategy, including the integration of CloudFront for efficient content delivery. As a part of the long-term roadmap, our team implemented the Hyvä Theme along with Hyva Checkout customization and Google Address Auto-complete at Checkout, leveraging its lightweight architecture and reduced JavaScript complexity to significantly improve page speed, enhance SEO, and deliver a seamless, high-performance shopping experience. The Strategy Our approach focused on a comprehensive optimization of the store, leveraging CloudFront and Varnish to enhance content delivery and caching efficiency. To further elevate performance and user engagement, we implemented the Hyvä Theme, ensuring a faster, more responsive storefront with improved Core Web Vitals. Key enhancements included a streamlined One-Step Checkout to reduce cart abandonment, an upgraded search experience with ElasticSearch, seamless Social Integrations, and a restructured Checkout Flow. With a primary focus on delivering a superior user experience, these optimizations created a high-performing, conversion-driven eCommerce platform.
